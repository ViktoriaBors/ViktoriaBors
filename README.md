# Hi ðŸ‘‹

## I am Viktoria
1. Passionate web developer.
2. A geologist, environmental engineer and chemist.

I started my web development journey a few years back, next to a full time work. Now I am determined to make a career change and be a full time web developer. My main focus is front end, but I got some insight to back end technology (NodeJS/ExpressJS) during a project. 

Here is some short facts about me:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and React. 
- ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m proud of the "SpaceRock" - JSExamProject (see https://github.com/ViktoriaBors/JSExamProject). It was a really challenging full stack project.
- âš¡ Iâ€™m a morning person, I like to listen music during study and work.
