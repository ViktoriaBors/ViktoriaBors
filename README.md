# Hi  👋

## I am Viktoria
I'm a web dev newbie, ready to take on any challenge the industry throws at me. My main focus is on **JavaScript and Vue**, but I can also handle Node.js and MongoDB.

I began my web development journey during my maternity leave in 2020-2021, and I was determined to make it a successful career.

To reach my goal, I have been hitting the books and finishing bootcamp and different courses. I've been practicing a lot, and learning by doing, teaching and helping my fellow mates. I have been contributing to other projects and doing my own projects. I was able to host a "JS seance" for my classmates at ProOktatas bootcamp, where we did pair-coding, solved homeworks together and explained some theory to each other. It's like a mini-bootcamp within a bootcamp.

My hard work paid off, now I'm working for a company that builds web apps and software platforms for insurance companies. My job is to update product descriptions and implement new products by working on both the backend and frontend. On the backend, I use web services to make updates and on the frontend, I make sure the new products are visible on the user interface. The project is built using Vue.js and Node.js.

Fun fact, I am a morning person, which means I'm always the first one to debug the code, and the last one to go to bed.

So, to sum it up, I am a career changer who started as a geologist and environmental engineer, but now I am a web developer with a lot of experience, a lot of hard work, and a lot of caffeine.

**Here is some other facts about me:**
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **My portfolio**, see on https://www.viktoria-pajuste.hu/

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Vue**, See my journey here: https://github.com/ViktoriaBors/frameworks or https://dev.to/viktoriabors
