# Hi ðŸ‘‹

## I am Viktoria
Entry level / Career changer web developer, who is ready to take all the challenges within the industry. My main focus is on JavaScript and React, but I am familiar with Node JS as a back end technology. 

I started my web development journey a few years back (2020-2021), next to a full time work. Now I am determined to make it as a career.

What is my plan to reach that? Study at a bootcamp, learn more myself, practice a lot, contribute to other projects and do own projects.  
My brain is like a sponge and still able to absorb more information.

Until now I have made a few bigger and many small projects. Moreover I have hosted a "JS seance" to my classmates during the JavaScript module at ProOktatas bootcamp, where we did pair-coding, solved our homework together and tried to explain some theory to each other.  

Why am I a career changer? I am originally an experienced geologist and environmental engineer with many years of environmental laboratory work such as asbestos identification, sample preparation and usage of laboratory instruments such as ICP and GC.


Here is some other short facts about me:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and React. See my journey here: https://github.com/ViktoriaBors/learningReact  
- ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m proud of the "SpaceRock" - JSExamProject (see https://github.com/ViktoriaBors/SpaceRock). It was a really challenging full stack project.
- âš¡ Iâ€™m a morning person, I like to listen music during study and work.
